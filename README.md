# Movie Seating APP

A backend for a Movie Seating Reservation Application.

## Status: Incomplete

All non login routes require a JWT token.  Currently have routes for adding most objects to database.

Database has the following tables:
1. User related: User, Roles, Reservations
2. Theater Related: Location, Theater, Seats, Showing
3. Movie Related: Movie, actor, genre

Some routes have been implemented for the above tables, but not all required for the complete application.
